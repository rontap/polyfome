polyfome 0.9.5
========
Google's Polymer is a really great API, but for some it might be too complicated, or others may find it too hard to start.
Polymer For Me (polyfome) is a solution for that. If used with polymer, it links and builds automatically the page.
example: http://elemential.net/polyfome/test.html

*Note* This version is only for internal elemential use. It does not work like an API yet

Features
========

*Note* You'll need a version of Polymer (included in a tar.gz) in the 2nd root folder of your project. Like this:
