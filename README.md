polyfome 1.1.1
========
Google's Polymer is a really great API, but for some it might be too complicated, or others may find it too hard to start.
Polymer For Me (polyfome) is a solution for that. If used with polymer, it links and builds automatically the page.
example: http://elemential.net/polyfome/test.html

*Note* This version is only for internal elemential use. It does not work like an API yet
